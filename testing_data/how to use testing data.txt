When running with debug = true the script uses the workstation and sequencer_temp folders in this folder as mock runfolders.
These folders contain quite a few files.
Debug mode also prints extra info to screen including some instruction, however to see this it must be run from the command line, not task scheduler.

On the sequencers Python lives in C://ProgramData/Miniconda (or something like this) - the ProgramData folder is hidden so you need to type it in.

The RunInfo.xml has been moved out of the dummy workstation runfolder which should result in a failed integrity test. 
The script waits 15 seconds and the debug messages prompt you to move the missing file(s) back into the runfolder.
The test should then pass.

After testing:
Move the RunInfo.xml file back out of the run folder for future testing.
Remember to turn debug back to False.
